        <h2>1. Organic Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of carbon-containing compounds and their properties, reactions, and synthesis. Organic chemistry is fundamental in the development of pharmaceuticals, plastics, and many other synthetic materials.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Inorganic Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of inorganic compounds, which include metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds. It focuses on the behavior, characteristics, and synthesis of inorganic substances.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Physical Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of the physical properties and behavior of matter. It combines principles of physics and chemistry to understand how chemical reactions occur and how substances interact at a molecular and atomic level.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Analytical Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of the composition of substances. It involves techniques and methods for identifying and quantifying the chemical components of a sample.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Biochemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of the chemical processes within and related to living organisms. It is a branch that bridges biology and chemistry, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that support life.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Environmental Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of chemical processes occurring in the environment. It includes the analysis of pollutants, the chemical composition of natural substances, and the effects of human activity on the environment.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Industrial Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of chemical processes in industry. This includes the production of chemicals, the development of new materials, and the improvement of manufacturing processes.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Theoretical Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The use of mathematical models and simulations to understand and predict chemical behavior. It provides insights into molecular structure, reaction dynamics, and other chemical phenomena.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Polymer Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of polymers, which are large molecules made up of repeating units. This branch focuses on the synthesis, properties, and applications of polymeric materials.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Nuclear Chemistry</h2>
        <p>Description: The study of radioactive substances and nuclear processes. It includes the study of nuclear reactions, radioactivity, and the applications of nuclear technology.</p>
