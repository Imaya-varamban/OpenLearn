    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the study of matter, its composition, structure, properties, and the changes it undergoes. Matter is made up of substances that can be classified broadly into elements and compounds.</p>

    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>An element is a pure substance that consists of only one type of atom. It cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of Elements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Elements are the simplest form of matter.</li>
        <li>They consist of identical atoms with the same atomic number.</li>
        <li>They cannot be decomposed by chemical means.</li>
        <li>Some elements exist in different structural forms called allotropes.</li>
        <li>Elements are classified as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Elements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Metals</strong>: Good conductors of heat and electricity (e.g., Iron - Fe).</li>
        <li><strong>Nonmetals</strong>: Poor conductors, brittle (e.g., Oxygen - O).</li>
        <li><strong>Metalloids</strong>: Have properties of both metals and nonmetals (e.g., Silicon - Si).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Periodic Table and Elements</h2>
    <p>The periodic table is an arrangement of elements based on their atomic number. It provides valuable information about the chemical behavior and properties of elements.</p>

    <h2>Compounds</h2>
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>A compound is a pure substance composed of two or more different elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of Compounds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Has a fixed composition.</li>
        <li>Properties differ from those of its elements.</li>
        <li>Held together by chemical bonds.</li>
        <li>Can be separated only by chemical reactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Compounds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ionic Compounds</strong>: Formed by electron transfer (e.g., NaCl).</li>
        <li><strong>Covalent Compounds</strong>: Formed by electron sharing (e.g., H₂O).</li>
        <li><strong>Metallic Compounds</strong>: Involve free movement of electrons (e.g., alloys).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Common Compounds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water (H₂O)</li>
        <li>Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)</li>
        <li>Sodium Chloride (NaCl)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Theories Related to Elements and Compounds</h2>
    <h3>1. Dalton’s Atomic Theory</h3>
    <p>All matter is composed of small indivisible particles called atoms. Atoms of the same element are identical, while compounds form from fixed ratios of different atoms.</p>

    <h3>2. Law of Definite Proportions</h3>
    <p>A compound always contains the same elements in the exact same proportions by mass.</p>

    <h3>3. Law of Multiple Proportions</h3>
    <p>When two elements form different compounds, the mass of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the other follows a simple whole-number ratio.</p>

    <h3>4. Chemical Bonding Theory</h3>
    <p>Elements form compounds through chemical bonding, involving ionic, covalent, or metallic bonds.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Elements and compounds form the foundation of chemistry. Elements are the simplest substances, while compounds result from chemical combinations of elements. Understanding these concepts helps explain the behavior of matter and chemical reactions.</p>
