        <h2>1.1 Motion of Bodies</h2>
        <p>Mechanical motion of a body is the change in its position with time relative
            to other bodies.
            We encounter motion of bodies very frequently in our everyday life,
            science and technology. We observe the motion of human beings and
            animals, the motion of water in rivers and seas, and the motion of air
            (wind). Transport facilities, various mechanisms, machines, instruments,
            projectiles, etc. execute motion. The Earth and other planets move in space
            as well as comets, meteors (Fig. 1), the Moon, artificial satellites of the
            Earth and spacecraft launched to other planets of the Solar system. The Sun
            moves relative to other stars which, in turn, move relative to one another.
            Atoms, molecules, electrons, protons, alpha-particles (Fig. 2) and other
            elementary particles (the smallest parts of matter) are in motion.</p>
            <p>The branch of physics that studies the mechanical motion of bodies and the conditions of rest is called mechanics (from the Greek word <i>mechane</i> - machine, tool). The first studies on mechanical motion date back to ancient times. They were prompted by the practical needs of human beings, e.g. agriculture, the manufacture of tools, and house construction.</p>

        <p>Practical­
            ly all physical phenomena involve the motion of bodies. Thus, we begin thestudy of physics with an analysis of the motion of bodies. This branch of
            physics is called mechanics.
            The word “mechanics” takes its origin from the Greek word mechane
            which means machine or tool. Even in ancient times, Egyptians, and later
            Greeks, Romans and other peoples constructed various machines for
            transportation, construction and military purposes (Fig. 3). The operation
            of these machines was based on the movement of levers, wheels, ropes, and
            other mechanisms, which caused the motion of loads being lifted or
            displaced. The investigation of the operation of these machines gave birth
            to the science about the motion of bodies, viz. mechanics.
            Mechanics also includes the study of conditions under which bodies re­
            main at rest, viz. equilibrium conditions. Such problems play a decisive
            role in construction and industrial engineering. When a house built of toy
            blocks, a large building or a bridge break, this means that equilibrium con­
            ditions for these bodies have been violated.</p>

        <h2>1.2 Kinematics - Relative Nature of Motion and State of Rest</h2>
        <p>To study motion, we must first of all know how to describe it. For the time
            being, we are not interested in the cause of motion. The branch ofmechanics which studies motion without investigating the reasons behind it
            is called kinematics.</p>
        <p>IThe motion of each body can be analysed relative to any other bodies.
            A given body moves differently relative to different bodies: a suitcase lying
            on a shelf in a moving train is at rest relative to the carriage but moves
            relative to the Earth. A balloon carried by wind moves relative to the Earth
            but is at rest relative to air. An aeroplane flying in a squadron is at rest
            relative to the other planes in the squadron but moves relative to the Earth
            at a high velocity (say, 800 km/h); the velocity of this plane relative to a
            plane moving in the opposite direction with the same velocity is
            1600 km/h.</p>
        <p>In movies, the same motion is often shown relative to different bodies.
                For example, a train is shown moving against the background of a land­
                scape (motion relative to the Earth), and then a compartment of a carriage
                with trees running past the window (motion relative to the carriage).
            
        </p>
        <p>Every motion, as well as the state o f rest (as a special case of motion), is
            relative. In order to answer the question whether a body is at rest or in mo­
            tion and what the nature of this motion is, it is necessary to indicate the
            bodies relative to which the motion of the given body is considered. Other­
            wise, the statement about the motion of the body is meaningless.</p>
        <p>The bodies relative to which a given motion is considered form a
            reference system. The choice of the reference system for analysing a given
            motion depends on the conditions of the problem. For example, if an
            enemy plane is to be hit from the ground, the aiming should depend on the
            velocity of the plane in the reference system fixed to the Earth (in the exam­
            ple considered above, this velocity was 800 km/h), but to hit the same
            plane from another plane flying towards the first one, one should proceed
            from the velocity of the target in the reference system fixed to the second
            plane flying from the opposite direction (1600 km/h). When motion on the
            surface of the Earth is studied, the reference system is usually fixed to the
            Earth (although, as was noted above, a train, a plane or any other body can
            also be taken as a reference system). Studying the motion of the Earth as a
            whole or the motion of planets, the Sun and stars are taken as the reference
            system. It will be shown in Chap. 2 that this system is especially convenient
            for studying the laws of dynamics.</p>
