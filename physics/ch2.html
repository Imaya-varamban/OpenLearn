        <h2>1.3  Trajectory of Motion</h2>
        <p>To describe the motion of a body, we must indicate how the positions of its
            points change with time. During the motion, each point of the bodydescribes a certain line, viz. the trajectory o f motion. Moving a piece of
            chalk over a blackboard, we leave a track on it, viz. the trajectory of mo­
            tion of the edge of the chalk. A writing is the trajectory of the tip of a pen.
            The luminous track of a meteor in the night sky (see Fig. 1) and the cloudy
            tracks of alpha-particles (see Fig. 2) are the trajectories of the meteor and
            alpha-particles. Astronomers expecting a solar eclipse calculate the trajec­
            tory of motion of the Moon’s shadow over the surface of the Earth
            beforehand. Figure 4 shows such a trajectory for the nearest total solar
            eclipse.

            of October 16, 2126.</p>
            <p>TSince the motion is relative, the trajectory o f motion may depend on the
                choice o f the reference system. For instance, in the absence of wind, to an
                observer in a carriage at rest the rain drops seem to fall vertically: rain
                drops leave behind vertical tracks on the window glass. If, however, the
                train starts off, the rain drops seem to fall obliquely with respect to the
                moving carriage: rain drops leave behind inclined tracks on the window,
                their slope being the larger, the higher the velocity of the train. Figure 5
                shows the trajectory of point P on the rim of a wheel relative to the surface
                of the Earth (the wheel is rolling over a straight road). Naturally, the tra­
                jectory of point P relative to the cart is the rim circumference itself.</p>

        <h2>1.4. Translatory and Rotary Motion of a Body</h2>
        <p>The trajectories of different points of a body may be different. This can be
            visually demonstrated by rapidly moving, for example, a splinter
            smouldering at two ends in a dark room. The human eye has the property
            of persistence of vision for about 0.1 s. Therefore, we perceive the trajec­
            tories of the smouldering ends of the splinter as luminous lines and can
            compare the two trajectories (Fig. 6).</p>
        <p>The simplest motion of a body is such that all its points move similarly,
            describing identical trajectories. This type of motion is known as
            translatory motion. We can observe a translatory motion by displacing the
            splinter so that it always remains parallel to itself. The trajectories in a
            translatory motion can be either straight lines (Fig. la) or curves (Fig. lb).
            It can be proved that in translatory motion any straight line drawn in a
            body remains parallel to itself. This typical feature is convenient to use
            when one has to determine whether or not a given motion is translatory. In
            a rolling cylinder, for example, straight lines crossing its axis do not remain
            parallel to themselves since rolling is not a translatory motion. When a
            T-square and a triangle move over a drawing board, any straight line
            drawn in them remains parallel to itself, and, hence, their motion is
            translatory (Fig. 8). A needle in a sewing machine, a piston in the cylinder
            of a steam engine or internal combustion engine, the hood of a motor car
            (but not its wheels!) moving on a straight road are examples of bodies in
            translatory motion.</p>

            <p><strong>Fig. 6:</strong> The trajectories A A ' and
                B B ' of the smouldering ends
                of a splinter are different.</p>


        <p>Another simple type of motion is rotary motion, or rotation. In rotary
            motion, all points of the body move in circles whose centres lie on a
            straight line. This line is called the rotation axis (straight line OO' inFig. 9). The circles lie in parallel planes that are perpendicular to the rota­
            tion axis. The points lying on the rotation axis remain at rest. Rotation is
            not a translatory motion since only straight lines that are parallel to the
            rotation axis remain parallel to themselves in this motion (like the straight
            line BC in Fig. 9).
            The diurnal motion of the Earth is a rotary motion. The oscillations of
            the pendulum of a clock is also an example of rotation. Rotation is fre­
            quently encountered in engineering: wheels, pulleys, shafts and axles of
            various mechanisms, crankshafts, air screws, pointers of measuring in­
            struments, etc. execute rotary motions.</p>

            rotation axis remain parallel to themselves in this motion (like the straight
            line BC in Fig. 9).
