        <h2>1.7. Measurement of Length</h2>
        <p>The base unit of length is a metre (m). Initially, the standard metre was
            taken as the distance between two marks on a specially made platinum-iridium rod of length 102 cm, which is stored at the International Bureau
            of Weights and Measures near Paris (Fig. 14). The material and shape of
            the rod, as well as the conditions in which it was stored, were chosen so as
            to ensure the invariability o f the sample in the best possible way. In par­
            ticular, measures were taken to maintain a constant temperature of the
            rod. Meticulously prepared secondary standards, viz. copies of this sam­
            ple, are stored at institutes of weights and measures in many countries.
            It was planned to choose 1/40000000 of the length of the Earth’s meri­
            dian as the standard metre. However, when it turned out that the precision
            of measurements on the surface of the Earth was insufficient, it was decid­
            ed not to replace the existing standard or introduce corrections on the basis
            of more accurate measurements, but preserve the sample as the unit of
            length. This sample is about 0.2 mm shorter than 1/40000000 of the
            Earth’s meridian.

        <p>Besides this base unit, other units are also used in science and engineer­
            ing, which are larger or smaller than metre by factors of ten: 2
            kilometre (1 km = 1000 m);
            centimetre (1cm = 0.01 m);
            millimetre (1 mm = 0.001 m);
            micrometre (1 jnn = 0.001 mm = 0.000001 m);
            nanometre (1 nm = 0.000000001 m).
            2 Decimal multiples and fractional units, as well as their notations, are formed with the
            help of factors and prefixes, e.g., 109 — giga (G), 106 — mega (M), 103 — kilo (k), 102 — hec-
            to (h), 1 0 "1 — deci (d), 10" 2 — centi (c), 10"3*— milli (m), 1 0 "6 — micro (/*), 10"9 — nano
            (n). — Eds.</p>

            <p>In Great Britain, the USA and some other countries, the so-called
                British units of length are still widely used:
                1 inch = 25.4 mm;
                1 foot = 12 inches = 304.8 mm;
                1 statute mile = 1609 m;
                1 nautical mile = 1852 m (the length of the one-minute arc of the Earth's meridian).
                The fact that there exists a great number of units of length (as well as
                units for other physical quantities) presents difficulties in practical calcula­
                tions. For this reason, the international standard definitions of units for all
                physical quantities have been worked out. The set of these definitions is
                called the S I system o f units (for the French S ystim e International). This
                system is used in science and technology in many countries throughout the
                world.</p>

                <p>In this system of units, a metre is defined as the length equal to
                    1650763.73 wavelengths of the orange line emitted by a special lamp in
                    which the krypton-86 gas glows under the action of electric discharge.3
                    The number of wavelengths is chosen so that this unit of length coincides to
                    the greatest possible extent with the standard metre stored in Paris. For this
                    reason, the unit of length was not chosen in such a way as to contain a
                    round integral number of wavelengths (say, a million). This new unit can
                    be reproduced (optically) to a higher degree of accuracy than the previous
                    standard metre. It is very convenient that there is no need to resort to a uni­
                    que sample to reproduce the unit of length. It is sufficient to make a special
                    krypton lamp and observe the light emitted by it.To measure length in practice, including the distance between two posi­
                    tions of a point on its trajectory, copies of secondary standards are used,
                    viz. rods, rulers or tape measures that are equal to the length of the stan­
                    dard or of its parts (centimetres, millimetres). The zero of the ruler is made
                    to coincide with one end of the segment being measured and the division
                    standing against its other end is marked. If the second end does not coin­
                    cide with any division on the scale, then one should approximately deter­
                    mine the fraction of a division corresponding to this end.</p>

                    <p>Various auxiliary attachments are used to reduce inevitable errors in measurements.
                        Figure 15 shows one o f such attachments, viz. a vernier caliper. The vernier is an additional
                        scale sliding along the main scale. The divisions o f the vernier are smaller than the divisions of
                        the main scale by 0.1 o f their length. If, for example, the division of the main scale is 1 mm,
                        the division o f the vernier has the length o f 0.9 mm. It can be seen from the figure that the
                        diameter o f the ball being measured is larger than 11 mm but smaller than 12 mm. In order to
                        find the number o f decimal fractions of a millimetre in the remaining part of the division, we
                        must find out the vernier division which coincides with one o f the divisions of the main scale.
                        In the figure, it is the ninth division o f the vernier. This means that the eighth, seventh, etc.</p>

        <h2>1.8. Measurement of Time Intervals</h2>
        <p>The choice of the unit of time can be made on the basis of the duration of
            some recurring process. From ancient times, the duration of one complete
            rotation of the Earth about its axis relative to the Sun (a day) was taken as
            a unit of time. Since the duration of this rotation slightly differs during a
            year (almost by 1 min), we take for the unit of time the average value of
            this quantity over a year. Days are divided into hours, minutes and
            seconds.
            The second (s) is one of the base units in SI. It is defined as the time in­
            terval equal to the sum of 9 192631 770 periods of radiation corresponding
            to the transition between two definite energy levels in the cesium-133 atom.
            The second is approximately equal to 1/86400 of the mean solar day.
            Various recurring processes can be used for constructing timepieces,
            viz. the instruments for measuring time intervals.
        </p>
        <p>In old times, clepsydras (water clocks) were used, in which time was
            determined from the amount of water flowing from one vessel to another
            (Fig. 16). The duration of the same time interval was reproduced with the
            help of a sand glass in which a definite amount of sand runs through a nar­
            row tube (Fig. 17). The accuracy of these instruments is not high.
            Various oscillatory processes, like oscillations of a pendulum, viz. a
            load suspended by a thread or rod (wall clock pendulum), recur with a
            much higher accuracy. If the amplitude of a swinging pendulum is not verylarge, the period of oscillations (the time of a swing from an extreme posi-
            lion to and fro) practically does not depend on the amplitude and is deter­
            mined only by the pendulum length. The fact that the period of oscillations
            of a pendulum is independent of the amplitude was established by the
            Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) and was later
            used by the Dutch physicist and mathematician Ch. Huygens (1629-1695)
            who created the first pendulum clock in 1657. In this clock, oscillations are
            counted with the help of a system of wheels. After each oscillation, the
            hands of the clock turn through a certain angle so that the time interval can
            be determined by the change in the positions of the hands.</p>

        <p>Later, a pocket watch was invented. In this instrument, the oscillating
            pendulum is replaced by a wheel which is attached to a spiral spring (so-
            called balance-wheel) and oscillates relative to the axle about the
            equilibrium position at a constant period determined by the properties of
            the balance-wheel, or the spiral spring. A stopwatch, i.e. the watch started
            and stopped by pressing a button, is especially convenient in practice. It
            has a long hand making a revolution per minute, which enables one to
            measure decimal fractions of a second on the dial plate.</p>


        <p>IAfter clocks with a pendulum (and later with a balance-wheel) had
been invented, all other types of mechanical clocks became obsolete as less
accurate. However, the sand glass is still in use, for example, in medicalpractice for such treatments (baths and others), where only one definite
time interval has to be counted. The dropping bottle and stroboscope
described in Sec. 1.6 are also a kind of clock.
In modern technology, time intervals are measured with increasingly
high accuracy with the help of oscillating quartz crystals (quartz clock) or
vibrations of molecules (molecular clock). Quartz and molecular clocks
make it possible to measure time intervals to within 10“ 6, 10“ 9 and even
10” 12 fractions of a second.</p>
