        <h2>1.5. Motion of a Point</h2>
        <p>To describe the motion of a body, we must know how its various points
            move. But if a body is in translatory motion, all its points move in the same
            way. Therefore, to describe a translatory motion it is sufficient to describe
            the motion of its any points. If different points of a body move differently,
            it is still possible sometimes to confine the description to the motion of a
            single point. This refers to the case when we are interested only in the
            change of the position of the body as a whole, for example, as in the
            analysis of the flight of a bullet or an aeroplane, the motion of a ship in the
            sea, the motion of a planet around the Sun, and so on. Thus, while study­
            ing the motion of a planet around the Sun, it is sufficient to describe the
            motion of its centre.</p>
        <p>Consequently, in some cases the description of the motion of a body is
            reduced to the description of the motion of a point.
            Various types of motion of a point differ first of all in the shape of the trajectories. If the trajectory is a straight line, the motion of the point is
            referred to as rectilinear (motion in a straight line). If the trajectory is a
            curve, the motion is said to be curvilinear. The motion of a body as a whole
            can be treated as rectilinear or curvilinear only if we can limit ourselves to a
            description of motion of a single point of the body. Generally speaking,
            some points of a body can move in straight lines, while its other points are
            in a curvilinear motion.
            The motion of a point in a straight line is the simplest type of motion.
            The next nineteen sections of this book will be devoted to an analysis of
            this type of motion.</p>

        <h2>1.6. Description of Motion of a Point</h2>
        <p>The trajectory of motion indicates all the positions occupied by a point.
            However, even if we know the trajectory, we cannot say whether the point
            moved rapidly or slowly on individual segments of the trajectory, whether
            it stopped or moved continuously, and so on. To obtain a complete
            description of motion, we must also know at what instant of time the point
            occupied a certain position on the trajectory. For this purpose, it is
            necessary to mark all points of the trajectory in a certain way and “cor­
            relate” each point to the moment of time when the moving point passed
            through this mark.
        </p>
        <p>On railways and highways, such a marking-out is made by installing
            mileposts along the track. They help to determine at what distance from
            the initial point a train or a car is. The number on a post passed by the train
            directly indicates the distances from an initial point which is usually a large
            city situated on this road.</p>
        <p>Let us start with an analysis of the motion of a point in a straight line.
            In this case, the straight line along which the point moves can be taken as
            the x-axis with the origin O at an arbitrary point (Fig. 10). Then the posi­
            tion of the point on the trajectory will be determined by the segment laid
            from point O to a given point (segments OA and OB in Fig. 10). To
            distinguish points lying on different sides of point O, the position of points
            for which the segment is laid in the direction of the x-axis is determined by
            the length of the segment with the plus sign (point A in Fig. 10), while theposition of points for which the segment is laid in the opposite direction is
            determined by the length of the segment with the minus sign (point B in
            Fig. 10). The length of the segment taken with the appropriate sign is
            called the coordinate x of the point. For example, the coordinate of point
            A in Fig. 10 is xA = 2.5, while the coordinate of point B is xB = - 3.5.
            Suppose that a point has moved from A t o B (Fig. 11). The segment A B
            directed from the initial to the final position is called the displacement o f
            the point. 1 The length of a segment is always expressed by a positive
            number. We shall call this number the magnitude o f displacement.</p>
        <p>If the point made two consecutive displacements A B and BC, the resul­
            tant displacement is A C \ Figure 11 shows that if the displacements being
            combined have the same direction (Fig. 11a), the direction of the resultant
            displacement coincides with the direction of the components, and the
            magnitude of the resultant displacement is equal to the sum of the
            magnitudes of the components.Jlf, however, the displacements being com­
            bined have opposite directions (Fig. 116 and c), the direction of the resul­
            tant displacement coincides with the direction of the component whose
            magnitude is larger. The resultant displacement in this case is equal in
            magnitude to the difference of the magnitudes of the components:
            magnitude of A C = Imagnitude of A B - magnitude of B C \ .
            The distance covered by the point along its trajectory is known as the
            path length. The path length, usually denoted by s 9 is expressed by a
            positive number. If the direction of motion does not change during some
            period of time, the path length (in the case of rectilinear motion) coincides
            with the magnitude of the displacement. If the direction of motion
            changes, the time interval under consideration (for example, the time *AC
            during which the point is displaced by AC) should be divided into the intervals during which the direction of motion remains unchanged, the distance
            covered by the point on each interval should be calculated, and all these
            path lengths should be added. For example, if in the case depicted in
            Fig. 11b the direction of motion has not changed over displacements AB
            and BC, the distance covered during the time ^AC is equal to the sum of the
            magnitudes of displacements AB and BC.
            In order to “correlate” the marked points of the trajectory to the
            moments of time at which the moving point passes through the marks, a
            certain instant of time is chosen as the initial one, and each position of the
            moving point on the trajectory is put into correspondence with the time in­
            terval that has passed from the initial moment of time. We shall denote
            time intervals by t.</p>

        <p>On a railroad, this correlation can be made by a passenger on a train,
            who notes with the help of his watch the instants at which the train passes
            by mileposts. Such a correlation can also be made by observers on the
            railroad station who mark with the help of a clock the time when the train
            passes by a station. Referees of sport events, who record with a stopwatch
            the instant of time when a skier crosses the finish line or an aeroplane flies
            over a control point, correlate the position of a moving body on its trajec­
            tory to some instant of time. In this case, the initial moment is the moment
            of start.
            At a school laboratory, such a correlation can be made with the help of a
            dropping bottle (Fig. 12) mounted on a moving body, for example, a cart
            or a spring toy car. The drops of ink falling in equal time intervals mark the
            position of the body on its trajectory. The moment corresponding to the
            falling of a certain drop is taken as the initial instant of time.
            The stroboscopic method of observation is sometimes used to study the
            motion. A stroboscope is a device producing intermittent light flashes of
            short duration at equal intervals of time. A device in which short current
            pulses cause bright flashes in a special lamp can be used for this purpose.
            An opaque disc with a slit, rotating in front of an ordinary lamp, also pro­
            duces stroboscopic light.</p>

        <p>Suppose, for example, that the motion of a ball rolling down an in­
            clined trough is studied. If the experiment is carried out in a dark room,
            and the ball is illuminated by stroboscopic light, the ball will be seen only in
            the positions where it is illuminated by a flash. If we place a ruler with divi­
            sions along the trough, it will also be illuminated, and the positions of the
            ball relative to the ruler at the instants of flashes can be registered (Fig. 13).
            In order to record all the positions of the ball, the pattern can be
            photographed by a camera with an open shutter throughout the motion.
            By using a stroboscope, we can see simultaneously a number of dif­
            ferent positions of an object without resorting to a photograph. If several
            consecutive flashes of a stroboscope occur in 0.1 s, we shall see several con­
            secutive positions of the ball due to the persistence of vision. A similar pat­
            tern can be observed if we rapidly move a bright rod illuminated by a
            daylight lamp or some other gas-discharge tube. Such lamps fed by an
            alternating current produce one hundred flashes per second, which allows
            us to see simultaneously a number of consecutive positions of the rod. One
            can also see several positions of one’s waving hand in a dark projection
            room during a film show (24 flashes per second).By “correlating” in some way separate positions of a moving point with
            the instants of time, we obtain a complete description of the motion of the
            point. This means that we know all the positions of the point and are able
            to determine for each of these positions the distance along the trajectory
            from the initial point and the time interval that has elapsed from the initial
            moment.
            Thus, any description of motion of a point is based on the measurement
            of distances and intervals of time. It should be noted that the initial point
            on the trajectory and the initial moment of time can be chosen arbitrarily,
            from the considerations of convenience of description of a given motion. A
            moving point must not necessarily be in the position s = 0 at the instant of
            time t = 0.</p>
